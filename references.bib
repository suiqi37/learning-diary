   abstract = {A fast detection and visualization of change in crisis areas is an important condition for planning and coordination of help. The availability of new satellites with high temporal resolution (e.g. RapidEye) and/or high spatial resolution (e.g. Quickbird) provides the basis for a better visualization of multitemporal change. For automated change detection, a large number of algorithms has been proposed and developed. This article describes the results of four texture based change detection approaches that were applied to satellite images of the Darfur crisis region. In our methodology we calculate firstly different texture characteristics ("energy", "correlation", "contrast" and "inverse distance moment"), for a whole image at two (or more) different times. The second step is to test the capability of known change detection methods (image-differencing, image-ratioing, regression analysis and principal component analysis) to visualize the change of settlement areas through these texture characteristics and texture images, respectively. The comparison of different texture characteristics with different change detection methods shows that best results can be obtained using a selective bitemporal principal component analysis with the texture feature "energy".},

   abstract = {Global warming has profound consequences for the climate of the American Southwest and its overallocated water supplies. This paper uses simulation modeling and the principles of decision making under uncertainty to translate climate information into tools for vulnerability assessment and urban climate adaptation. A dynamic simulation model, WaterSim, is used to explore future water-shortage conditions in Phoenix. Results indicate that policy action will be needed to attain water sustainability in 2030, even without reductions in river flows caused by climate change. Challenging but feasible changes in lifestyle and slower rates of population growth would allow the region to avoid shortage conditions and achieve groundwater sustainability under all but the most dire climate scenarios. Changes in lifestyle involve more native desert landscaping and fewer pools in addition to slower growth and higher urban densities. There is not a single most likely or optimal future for Phoenix. Urban climate adaptation involves using science-based models to anticipate water shortage and manage climate risk.},

   abstract = {Urban ecosystems are subjected to high temperatures-extreme heat events, chronically hot weather, or both-through interactions between local and global climate processes. Urban vegetation may provide a cooling ecosystem service, although many knowledge gaps exist in the biophysical and social dynamics of using this service to reduce climate extremes. To better understand patterns of urban vegetated cooling, the potential water requirements to supply these services, and differential access to these services between residential neighborhoods, we evaluated three decades (1970-2000) of land surface characteristics and residential segregation by income in the Phoenix, Arizona, USA metropolitan region. We developed an ecosystem service trade-offs approach to assess the urban heat riskscape, defined as the spatial variation in risk exposure and potential human vulnerability to extreme heat. In this region, vegetation provided nearly a 25°C surface cooling compared to bare soil on low-humidity summer days; the magnitude of this service was strongly coupled to air temperature and vapor pressure deficits. To estimate the water loss associated with land-surface cooling, we applied a surface energy balance model. Our initial estimates suggest 2.7 mm/d of water may be used in supplying cooling ecosystem services in the Phoenix region on a summer day. The availability and corresponding resource use requirements of these ecosystem services had a strongly positive relationship with neighborhood income in the year 2000. However, economic stratification in access to services is a recent development: no vegetation-income relationship was observed in 1970, and a clear trend of increasing correlation was evident through 2000. To alleviate neighborhood inequality in risks from extreme heat through increased vegetation and evaporative cooling, large increases in regional water use would be required. Together, these results suggest the need for a systems evaluation of the benefits, costs, spatial structure, and temporal trajectory for the use of ecosystem services to moderate climate extremes. Increasing vegetation is one strategy for moderating regional climate changes in urban areas and simultaneously providing multiple ecosystem services. However, vegetation has economic, water, and social equity implications that vary dramatically across neighborhoods and need to be managed through informed environmental policies. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

There are not many studies demonstrating such techniques in the context of the mountains of Nepal. The objective of this study was to explore and evaluate the use of modified band and ancillary data in Landsat and IRS image classification, and to produce a land use land cover map of the Galaudu watershed of Nepal. Classification of land uses were explored using supervised and unsupervised classification for 12 feature sets containing the LandsatMSS, TM and IRS original bands, ratios, normalized difference vegetation index, principal components and a digital elevation model. Overall, the supervised classification method produced higher accuracy than the unsupervised approach. The result from the combination of bands ration 4/3, 5/4 and 5/7 ranked the highest in terms of accuracy (82.86%), while the combination of bands 2, 3 and 4 ranked the lowest (45.29%).

   abstract = {The kappa coefficient is not an index of accuracy, indeed it is not an index of overall agreement but one of agreement beyond chance. Chance agreement is, however, irrelevant in an accuracy assessment and is anyway inappropriately modelled in the calculation of a kappa coefficient for typical remote sensing applications. The magnitude of a kappa coefficient is also difficult to interpret. Values that span the full range of widely used interpretation scales, indicating a level of agreement that equates to that estimated to arise from chance alone all the way through to almost perfect agreement, can be obtained from classifications that satisfy demanding accuracy targets (e.g. for a classification with overall accuracy of 95% the range of possible values of the kappa coefficient is −0.026 to 0.900). Comparisons of kappa coefficients are particularly challenging if the classes vary in their abundance (i.e. prevalence) as the magnitude of a kappa coefficient reflects not only agreement in labelling but also properties of the populations under study. It is shown that all of the arguments put forward for the use of the kappa coefficient in accuracy assessment are flawed and/or irrelevant as they apply equally to other, sometimes easier to calculate, measures of accuracy. Calls for the kappa coefficient to be abandoned from accuracy assessments should finally be heeded and researchers are encouraged to provide a set of simple measures and associated outputs such as estimates of per-class accuracy and the confusion matrix when assessing and comparing classification accuracy.},

   abstract = {Four binary thematic maps with combinations of two spatial autocorrelation levels and two different class proportions are simulated to study their effect on the precision of accuracy measures from different sampling designs. A series of eleven sample sizes (from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 1296) are simulated using three popular sampling designs, including simple random sampling (SRS), systematic sampling (SYS), and stratified random sampling (StrRS) on the four simulated maps. The conventional error matrix and related accuracy measures are calculated for each simulation, and the precision of different estimates of accuracy measures is compared among the three sampling designs. The selection of a particular sampling design and sample size depends on the spatial autocorrelation level, the class proportion difference, and the accuracy indices that a given application requires. In general, the class proportion difference has a greater impact on the performance of different sampling methods than the spatial autocorrelation level does on a map. For estimating the accuracy of individual classes, stratified sampling achieves better precision than SRS and SYS with smaller sample sizes, especially for estimating the small class. For estimating the overall accuracy, different sampling designs achieve very similar levels of precision with fewer samples. To achieve a better estimate of the kappa coefficient, stratified random sampling is recommended for use on a map with a high class proportion difference, while random sampling is preferred for a map with low spatial autocorrelation and a low class proportion difference. © 2008 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

   abstract = {Airborne and space-borne sensors are reviewed and evaluated in terms of their usefulness in responding to oil spills. Recent developments and trends in sensor technology are illustrated with specific examples. The discussion of the sensors is divided into two main categories, namely active and passive. Active sensors are those that provide their own source of illumination or excitation, whereas passive sensors rely on illumination from a secondary source. A common passive sensor is an infrared camera or an IR/UV (infrared/ultraviolet) system. The inherent weaknesses include the inability to discriminate oil on beaches, among seaweeds or debris. Among active sensors, the laser fluorosensor is a most useful instrument because of its unique capability to identify oil on backgrounds that include water, soil, ice and snow. It is the only sensor that can positively discriminate oil on most backgrounds. Disadvantages include the large size, weight and high cost. Radar offers the only potential for large area searches and foul weather remote sensing. Radar is costly, requires a dedicated aircraft, and is prone to many interferences. Equipment that measures relative slick thickness is still under development. Passive microwave has been studied for several years, but many commercial instruments lack sufficient spatial resolution to be practical, operational instruments. A laser-acoustic instrument, which provides the only technology to measure absolute oil thickness, is under development. Equipment operating in the visible region of the spectru, such as cameras and scanners, is useful for documentation or providing a basis for the overlay of other data. It is not useful beyond this because oil shows no spectral characteristics in the visible region which can be used to discriminate oil.},

Together these core features enable users to discover, analyze and visualize geospatial big data in powerful ways without needing access to supercomputers or specialized coding expertise. The development of GEE has created much enthusiasm and engagement in the remote sensing and geospatial data science fields. Yet after a decade since GEE was launched, its impact on remote sensing and geospatial science has not been carefully explored. Thus, a systematic review of GEE that can provide readers with the “big picture” of the current status and general trends in GEE is needed. To this end, the decision was taken to perform a meta-analysis investigation of recent peer-reviewed GEE articles focusing on several features, including data, sensor type, study area, spatial resolution, application, strategy, and analytical methods. A total of 349 peer-reviewed articles published in 146 different journals between 2010 and October 2019 were reviewed. Publications and geographical distribution trends showed a broad spectrum of applications in environmental analyses at both regional and global scales. Remote sensing datasets were used in 90% of studies while 10% of the articles utilized ready-to-use products for analyses. Optical satellite imagery with medium spatial resolution, particularly Landsat data with an archive exceeding 40 years, has been used extensively. Linear regression and random forest were the most frequently used algorithms for satellite imagery processing. Among ready-to-use products, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used in 27% of studies for vegetation, crop, land cover mapping and drought monitoring. The results of this study confirm that GEE has and continues to make substantive progress on global challenges involving process of geo-big data.},
