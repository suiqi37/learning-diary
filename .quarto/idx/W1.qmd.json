In cloudy areas such as the UK, there may be many days when the picture will not be available\n\n### Four resolutions\n\n-   Spatial = the size of the raster grid per pixel (e.g. 20cm or 30m)\n-   Spectral = the number of bands it records data in（We can only observe where there aren't absorbed by the atmosphere.）can be discrete (e.g. multi spectral) or continuous (e.g. hyper spectral)\n-   Temporal = the time it revisits (e.g. daily, every 7 days, on demand)\n-   Radiometric = identify differences in light or reflectance, in practice this is the range of possible values\n\n### what sensor is most appropriate depents on\n\n-   Size of features\n-   Date range\n-   Revisit requirement\n-   Spectral sensitivity\n-   Cost\n\n\\*Many studies use free landsat, and the accuracy is generally sufficient. If you need high precision, you need to buy it, and the price is relatively expensive.\n\n## Applications\n\nIn detecting oil spill, passive sensors cannot distinguish between oil, algae or debris on the beach. Among active sensors, the laser fluorescence sensor is the most useful instrument because of its unique ability to identify oil on backgrounds including water, soil, ice, and snow. It is the only sensor that can correctly differentiate oils against most backgrounds. The disadvantages are large volume, heavy weight and high cost. Radar offers unique potential for large area search and remote sensing of severe weather. Radar is expensive, requires specialized aircraft, and is susceptible to many jamming[@Fingas1997].\n\nPassive sensors carried by satellites represented by Landsat have evolved in more diverse field such as agriculture, forestry and range resources, land use and mapping, geology, hydrology, coastal resources and environmental monitoring in these recent years[@Ridwan2018].\n\nThe two main advantages of active remote sensing are: 1.Ability to collect images day and night.2. Unaffected by clouds and adverse weather conditions.\n\nThe two main advantages of passive remote sensing are: 1.The information is accessible to the public 2.Can detect a certain area more stably and continuously.\n\nPossibly due to differences in image processing, it is less common to use both sensor data for a study.\n\n## Reflection\n\nThis lesson talked about a lot of basic knowledge and principles of remote sensing, and explored the band of passive sensor. Many analyzes are based on band, so it is very useful to understand its principle. As for which sensor to choose this week, only talked about the selection principle, but it is very important to choose the appropriate time, research range, and resolution as the first step in the analysis.\n\nThere are many applications for viewing and processing remote sensing images, such as SNAP, QGIS, R, and GEE. It is better to choose a cloud that does not take up a lot of space, such as gee, and need to think about how to reduce the use of multiple software to analyze and process images in the workflow.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"W1.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"An Introduction to Remote Sensing"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"W1.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt","title":"An Introduction to Remote Sensing"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
