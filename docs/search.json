I have had two internships in the Planning Institute, and participated in the design and smart city research of a new district in Nanjing, China, and the historical heritage planning of Chengdu, China. I have only used remote sensing imagery to extract ndvi for land use evaluation before, but I don’t know anything about remote sensing. This course is a recommended course for the smart city pathway. I hope that I can have a general understanding of remote sensing images and analysis methods and their application in research from this course. I hope I can start from the acquisition of images and complete the analysis of urban problems (such as drought, urban heat island etc.) research."

    "text": "2.2 Applications\nIn detecting oil spill, passive sensors cannot distinguish between oil, algae or debris on the beach. Among active sensors, the laser fluorescence sensor is the most useful instrument because of its unique ability to identify oil on backgrounds including water, soil, ice, and snow. It is the only sensor that can correctly differentiate oils against most backgrounds. The disadvantages are large volume, heavy weight and high cost. Radar offers unique potential for large area search and remote sensing of severe weather. Radar is expensive, requires specialized aircraft, and is susceptible to many jamming(Fingas and Brown 1997).\nPassive sensors carried by satellites represented by Landsat have evolved in more diverse field such as agriculture, forestry and range resources, land use and mapping, geology, hydrology, coastal resources and environmental monitoring in these recent years(Ridwan et al. 2018).\nThe two main advantages of active remote sensing are: 1.Ability to collect images day and night.2. Unaffected by clouds and adverse weather conditions.\nThe two main advantages of passive remote sensing are: 1.The information is accessible to the public 2.Can detect a certain area more stably and continuously.\nPossibly due to differences in image processing, it is less common to use both sensor data for a study."

Among remote sensing datasets, optical satellite imagery with moderate spatial resolution, particularly Landsat data archived for over 40 years, was widely utilized. In satellite image processing, linear regression and random forest were the most frequently employed algorithms. As for the ready-to-use products, 27% of vegetation, crop, land cover mapping, and drought monitoring studies utilized the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)(Tamiminia et al. 2020). GEE has made significant progress and continues to do so in addressing global challenges related to geobig data processing.\nCurrently, GEE offers a restricted range of algorithms for object-based image analysis and clustering methods(Gorelick et al. 2017).

The experiments focused on land cover classification using multispectral (Landsat-7 ETM+) and hyperspectral (DAIS) data in test areas located in eastern England and central Spain. The findings demonstrate that the SVM classifier achieved higher classification accuracy compared to the ML and ANN classifiers. Furthermore, the results suggest that the SVM classifier is suitable for use with small training datasets and high-dimensional data.\nIn this article, one against one of SVM performs better than one against the rest, The higher training time requirements of the ‘one against one’ approach may be due the algorithm used to solve quadratic programming optimization problem.The results indicate that SVM can achieve high classification accuracy with high dimensional data, even if the size of the training dataset is small.\nIt is recommended to use one against one to generate multi-class SVM.

Furthermore, deep learning methods may overfit when available training samples are limited.\nThis study use simple random sampling (SRS), systematic sampling (SYS), and stratified random sampling (StrRS). The results are analyzed in terms of the correctly classified and misclassified proportion of individual classes, the overall accuracy, and the kappa coefficient of agreement. For estimating the overall accuracy, different sampling designs achieve very similar levels of precision with fewer samples. To achieve a better estimate of the kappa coefficient, stratified random sampling is recommended for use on a map with a high class proportion difference, while random sampling is preferred for a map with low spatial autocorrelation and a low class proportion difference.(Chen and Wei 2009)\nThe impact of spatial autocorrelation and class proportions on the choice of sampling method and sample size is complex. Recommendations for specific sampling methods and sizes depend on the level of spatial autocorrelation, differences in class proportions, and the required precision metrics for a given application"

    "text": "8.3 Reflection\nWhen calculating the accuracy of classification, unlike processing non-spatial data, spatial autocorrelation should also be taken into account. If it is not considered, it will lead to overfitted, so classification has a special test method for remote sensing applications.\nI agree with the view that “Kappa does not necessarily represent accuracy”. As (Foody 2020) said, it needs to be explained in conjunction with the confusion matrix and details of the sample.\n\n\n\n\nChen, Dong Mei, and Hui Wei. 2009. “The Effect of Spatial Autocorrelation and Class Proportion on the Accuracy Measures from Different Sampling Designs.” ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 64 (March): 140–50. https://doi.org/10.1016/J.ISPRSJPRS.2008.07.004.\n\n\nFoody, Giles M. 2020. “Explaining the Unsuitability of the Kappa Coefficient in the Assessment and Comparison of the Accuracy of Thematic Maps Obtained by Image Classification.” Remote Sensing of Environment 239 (March): 111630. https://doi.org/10.1016/J.RSE.2019.111630.\n\n\nToutin, Thierry. 2011. “State-of-the-Art of Geometric Correction of Remote Sensing Data: A Data Fusion Perspective.” Http://Dx.doi.org/10.1080/19479832.2010.539188 2: 3–35. https://doi.org/10.1080/19479832.2010.539188."

    "text": "9.2 Applications\nUse land surface temperature and vegetation indices from Landsat, calculate NDVI. Combined with weather station data, intraannual and interannual variations in the relationship between remotely sensed surface temperature, NDVI, and Sky Harbor Meteorology are analyzed to better understand the cooling effect provided by vegetation. The seasonal patterns that lead to the conclusion of the relationship between NDVI and surface temperature are consistently relevant at regional scales. The cooling ecosystem services produced by vegetation in the Phoenix metropolitan area are strongest in summer and weakest in winter. The availability of this ecosystem service in the summer significantly reduces Phoenix’s summer bare surface temperatures, which often exceed levels that are dangerous for humans. Promoting cool refuge through urban landscape design can be an efficient use of resources to mitigate thermal risk landscapes and reduce human vulnerability to heat(Jenerette et al. 2011).\nWhen assessing potential mitigation strategies for current and future urban climate change, a systematic analysis is necessary that explicitly assesses the benefits and consequences of various risk reduction and coping strategies (Gober and Kirkwood 2010).\nBut consider the issue of inequality. Without concerted efforts to intervene in management strategies, green space inequities will increase, leading to exacerbated temperature extremes and induced short- and long-term vulnerabilities. Increasing park vegetation in low-income neighborhoods is one strategy to more equitably redistribute urban green space and cooler temperatures."
