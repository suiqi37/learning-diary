    "text": "2.2 Applications\nIn detecting oil spill, passive sensors cannot distinguish between oil, algae or debris on the beach. Among active sensors, the laser fluorescence sensor is the most useful instrument because of its unique ability to identify oil on backgrounds including water, soil, ice, and snow. It is the only sensor that can correctly differentiate oils against most backgrounds. The disadvantages are large volume, heavy weight and high cost. Radar offers unique potential for large area search and remote sensing of severe weather. Radar is expensive, requires specialized aircraft, and is susceptible to many jamming.(Fingas and Brown 1997)\nPassive sensors carried by satellites represented by Landsat have evolved in more diverse field such as agriculture, forestry and range resources, land use and mapping, geology, hydrology, coastal resources and environmental monitoring in these recent years.(Ridwan et al. 2018)\nThe two main advantages of active remote sensing are: 1.Ability to collect images day and night.2. Unaffected by clouds and adverse weather conditions.\nThe two main advantages of passive remote sensing are: 1.The information is accessible to the public 2.Can detect a certain area more stably and continuously.\nPossibly due to differences in image processing, it is less common to use both sensor data for a study."
